Well, what can I say, I'm a VoIP developer and I love what I do.

I've experience with Kamailio, Opensips, Asterisk and Freeswitch.
If you need to configure them, integrate with existing applications, develop new ones or create a new module for Kamailio, I will be more than glad to discuss it with you.

I really like to develope with Perl, Python, Java and C. And I'm open to learn new ones.

I've acquired a taste for AI lately and I'm in the middle of finishing some online courses.

The objective of this blog is to become my notebook, not only for my work, but also for my journey through the AI landscape.

I hope you enjoy it.
